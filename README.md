RSS Viewer Extension
=========
This RSS Viewer Extension is a striped down version of RSS Subscription Extension.
I just wanted a simple icon which tells me if there is a feed for the page with it's name and a simple button to copy the link
![rss-list-extension popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asl97/rss-list-extension/master/screenshot.png)

I ain't quite sure about the naming since it isn't really a viewer but a listing/telling/showing extension >.>

This is a fork of the [RSS Subscription Extension(page-action-rss) by Michal Stanke](https://github.com/MikkCZ/page-action-rss)

Which is a fork of the [RSS Subscription Extension(chrome-rss) by Justin Kelly](https://github.com/justinkelly/chrome-rss)

Which was forked from discontinued extension by Google.


This original extension is published on the chrome webstore at:
